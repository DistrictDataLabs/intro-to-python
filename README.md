Intro to Python
===============
**The iPython notebooks and sample code for Introductory Python courses**

You're in the right place if you're looking for the material for one of the following courses:

* Georgetown University: XBUS-500 Foundations of Data Analytics and Data Science
* District Data Labs: Python for new Programmers
* District Data Labs: Building Python Data Apps

## Materials ##
The `Workshop.pynb` can be viewed on the iPython nbviewer application by using the following link: [nbviewer Intro to Python](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/bbengfort/intro-to-python/blob/master/Workshop.ipynb). If you'd like to run an interactive version of the notebook you must have iPython installed, then simply run:

    $ ipython notebook Workshop.pynb

After cloning or downloading the repository to a working directory.

The example program that we discussed in class, `clock.py` is a simple program that I use every day to print out formatted timestamps for use in the documents that I'm preparing. It is also a simple program for instruction purposes. You can run this program by:
    
    $ python clock.py code
    Mon Mar 10 08:43:26 2014 -0400
    
To see more formatting options, use `python clock.py help`.
